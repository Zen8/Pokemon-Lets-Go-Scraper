# Serebii Pokemon Scraper

First web scraper I've developed. It's purpose is to gather data relating to the spawn chance and locations of all the pokemon in Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee. <br />
Made this as I would like to get myself a "shiny living dex" - all Pokemon as shinies in the game. <br />
Code might not be the most efficient, and in some cases is quite messy. But for what I need it gets the job done. <br />

Data scraped from (Serebii)[https://serebii.net]
